# Train_Your_Ears

Introduction:

An android application that is a comprehensive tool in helping to train users’ ability in identifying specific pitches,
intervals, chords and chord progressions. The app is written in Android Studio using Java and XML. It’s unique advantage
comparing with other ear-training apps includes is its ability to generate a chord in different voicings rather than
the simplest one (users can control how complex the voicings are) which is important for honing users’ ability to 
identify a chord in multi-textured music. It also allows users to fully customize a chord and a chord progression.


Creator's Confession:

This android app was created in the summer of my freshmen year at Colby. I took the intro to cs course in Python and a second-level data structure course in Java when I started this app. But after a year's study, I still felt like I couldn't program stuff. I had little grasp about how to structure a program, mainly because the projects I do from the courses are provided with lots of hints (e.g first build class A, write methods 1, 2 & 3, then extend it with class B, etc.). In order to "see the big picture", I decided to build something from scratch, so I started this project. I spent a total of about 3 months on this project including the time of figuring out how to make different classes coordinate and learning the basic android studio tricks. My skills and understandings of programming have improved by a lot, and I am actually pretty content with this app that I've come up with. The structure of many parts of this program, as I later realized, are not very good, so that I would imagine that its not very efficient time wise and space wise. But it does work well as a ear-training tool with a few advanced features you don't find in most other apps out there. Hope you can enjoy it and hope your ears get more powerful :)
